Message lengths are ALWAYS $55+the actual length, so when it says "a message length of $04" it means $55+4=$59.



CHECKSUM
The last byte is the checksum of the entire frame. The checksum is determined so that the sum of all the bytes in the frame - including the frame ID, the length byte and the checksum byte itself - is zero, ignoring any carry bits.

For example the frame $F5,$57,$01,$00,$B3

Has a frame ID of $F7.
Has a length of $57-$55=$02 data bytes.
Contains two data bytes: $01,$00.
Has a checksum of $B3.

To calculate the checksum in hex:
Sum the bytes $F5+$57+$01+$00=$14D.
Find the remainder when the sum is divided by $100 which in this case is $4D.
The checksum will be $100-$4D=$B3.

To calculate the checksum in decimal:
Sum the bytes 245+87+1+0=333.
Find the remainder when the sum is divided by 256 which in this case is 77.
The checksum will be 256-77=179 (179 is $B3 in hexadecimal).
